![Responsive screenshot](/assets/images/readme-images/readme-responsive-image.png)


This website was created for a fictitious Yoga Studio located in Vienna, Autria. Magnolia Tree is a place, built to satisfy the needs and requests of women who are in their 30/40s, dealing with a busy schedule, looking for a moment on their days to work on their bodies and minds.
 
The site contains the home page with three  sections, a classes page in which is possible to see all the type of classes they offer and also their schedules, a contact page in which is possible to see all the available ways to get in touch with the studio and send them a request via their contact form, and the thank you page to which the user is redirected after filling out and sending the form.

The target audience is female adult individuals, 30/40s, living in or traveling to Vienna.

This website is the first of five projects that needs to be completed in order to receive a diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.

Requirements for the project is that the website has to be static and responsive using HTML5 and CSS3.

A live version of the project can be found here - https://angelicaguimaraes.github.io/magnolia_tree/

### Requirements

A static responsive website that incorporates the technologies I have learned so far that contains some advanced functionality. The development process needs to be well documented through a version controls system such as GitHub.

Required technologies: HTML, CSS

### Design

Since this is my first HTML/CSS project, the design has been influenced by the ”Love Running” project.

My goal was to create a website that could transmit to the users, the calm atmosphere of the Studio and, at the same time, how serious they take teaching the art of yoga and meditation, all of that, working with a balance between colors, images and functionality.

The Magnolia Tree website is a three page website divided into sections. Menu is fixed on top in order to ensure easy navigation between the pages.

#### Colors

The color palette was created using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

![Color Palette](/assets/images/readme-images/color-palette-magnolia-tree.png)

#### Typography

The [Google Font Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mont) was chosen as the main font with a fallback of Sans-Serif. Font weights of 300, 500 and 800 have been used on the website.

#### Images

Images have been chosen in accordance to color and content. The purpose of the website is to give a calm look and express quality. Images have been sized in order to match design.

## Technologies used

- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## Testing 

Test has been conducted using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari. Testing different devices and screen resolutions has been conducted using Google DevTools.

Listed is the main issues discovered.

1. Home page Hero-Image was not staying on the right place after addding the Hero-Image Text.
 - Solution: Removed it as a background-image from the style.css and moved it to index.html.
2. First colum of the Meditation Group Table shrinked after inserted the data.
 - Solution: Adjusted the data inserted.
3. Hero-Image were not taking 100% of the screen's width.
 - Solution: Resized the images to a larger size.
4. When tested in Lighthouse the website received a low score on performance, 73. The reason for thas was that the images size were too big.
 - Solution: Resized all the images and score increased to 99.
5. Poor performance on smaller screens. About Us and 2022 Events sections did not place them selfs properly.
 - Solution: Solved this by using media queries and now the elements are displayed as they should.
6. Menu not properly aligned with header on small screens and it gets cropped and divided.
 - Solution: Added new values in the existing media queries.
7. Menu still gets cropped on screens with resolutions below 320px. It looks good using Google DevTools but not on a physical device
 - Solution: Solved 20220325 - Removed from Unfixed bugs. Changed View Port Width on fonts in menu.

Apart from these issues there have been several minor issues. The majority of these has been due to miss spelled tags, attributes and other mistakes.
