            <h1>Our Classes</h1>
            <h2>Choose the one that better fits you</h2>
            <br>
            <p>We offer to our students the possibility to choose between private sessions or group classes. Whatever makes them feel more comfortable with.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All our private sessions are created thinking specifically to fit the physical and mental needs and desires of our students. So, don’t worry if you have any restrictions or if you think yoga is not for you. Our instructors will be ready to support you and help you to challenge yourself at every session, guiding you and assisting you so you don’t feel overwhelmed, and take from your session, all the benefits that are expected.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It doesn't matter if it's to meditate or to give your physical body that extra energy, all our group classes are built for a maximum of 10 participants, so all our students can receive the proper attention from our instructors.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All our group classes have a duration of 50 minutes. During this period of time, our students can enjoy a very welcoming environment, work their bodies and minds, and also enjoy, afterwards, all the benefits that yoga and meditation bring to them.</p>

A set of specific exercises, called poses, combined with specific breathing techniques and meditation principles are the building blocks of a yoga class. In a yoga class, as you learn to do yoga poses, you will be instructed to notice your breath and the way your body moves during the exercises.</p>  -->
