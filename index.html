            <h2>Your body and mind in perfect connection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Magnolia Tree is a yoga studio for anyone who is ready to relax, work hard, laugh or let go. We believe
                that yoga is for everyone regardless of age and body type. Whether you can touch your toes or not,
                Magnolia Tree welcomes you and we open our doors and our hearts to helping you challenge your physical
                body and mind.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We are a studio that offers Hatha and Vinyasa yoga classes in most levels. Their formats tap into
                static/still postures with longer holds between each posture. This can provide the student an
                opportunity to move deeper into their internal reflection. Regardless of the format, our classes will
                provide you an experience that leaves you feeling energized and uplifted.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our mission is to provide a genuine and sustainable yoga practice that will continue to evolve the
                physical and emotional health of our students. We are proud of the individual attention that our
                students receive. Our instructors are passionate about teaching and are always willing to take that
                extra step to ensure that no student feels left behind.</p>

                <br>
                <p id="about-yoga-content">More than a physical workout, yoga is a full mind and body exercise. A set of
                    specific exercises, called poses, combined with specific breathing techniques and meditation
                    principles are the building blocks of a yoga class. In a yoga class, as you learn to do yoga poses,
                    you will be instructed to notice your breath and the way your body moves during the exercises.</p>

                <br>
                <p id="about-meditation-content">Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a technique, such
                    as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity, to train
                    attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state. It may
                    significantly reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain; enhance peace, perception, self-concept,
                    and well-being.</p>
