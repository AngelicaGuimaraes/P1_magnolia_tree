            <h2>Your body and mind in perfect connection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Magnolia Tree is a yoga studio for anyone who is ready to relax, work hard, laugh or let go. We believe that yoga is for everyone regardless of age and body type. Whether you can touch your toes or not, Magnolia Tree welcomes you and we open our doors and our hearts to helping you challenge your physical body and mind.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We are a studio that offers Hatha and Vinyasa yoga classes in most levels. Their formats tap into static/still postures with longer holds between each posture. This can provide the student an opportunity to move deeper into their internal reflection. Regardless of the format, our classes will provide you an experience that leaves you feeling energized and uplifted.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our mission is to provide a genuine and sustainable yoga practice that will continue to evolve the physical and emotional health of our students. We are proud of the individual attention that our students receive. Our instructors are passionate about teaching and are always willing to take that extra step to ensure that no student feels left behind.</p>

            <div id="about-yoga-content">
                <p>More than a physical workout, yoga is a full mind and body exercise.
                A set of specific exercises, called poses, combined with specific breathing techniques and meditation principles are the building blocks of a yoga class. In a yoga class, as you learn to do yoga poses, you will be instructed to notice your breath and the way your body moves during the exercises. This is the foundation of a mind-body connection.</p>

                <p>Meditation can be defined as a set of techniques that are intended to encourage a heightened state of awareness and focused attention. Meditation is also a consciousness-changing technique that has been shown to have a wide number of benefits on psychological well-being.</p>
